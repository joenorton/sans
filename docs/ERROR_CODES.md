## 3) `ERROR_CODES.md` (stable catalog + examples)

**purpose:** make refusals uniform and automatable.

must include:

* the code namespace list + definitions (the catalog we outlined)
* 3–5 canonical examples showing:

  * macro detected
  * unsupported proc
  * missing keys for compare
  * order required
* required error payload shape (`code/message/loc/tokens/hint`)
