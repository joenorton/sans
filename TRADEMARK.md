Trademark Policy. 
Last Updated: February 1, 2026. 
0. Disclaimer Regarding SAS Institute Inc.
SAS® is a registered trademark of SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.  
The sans project is an independent, open-source compiler and runtime. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or supported by SAS Institute Inc. Any reference to "SAS," "SAS-like," or the SAS language within this repository is for descriptive and compatibility purposes only (nominative fair use).  
1. Purpose
This policy describes the conditions under which you may use the name "sans" and associated logos (collectively, the "Marks") in connection with this project.
While the software is available under the Apache 2.0 License, that license governs the copyright of the code, not the trademark (the project's identity). This policy ensures that users are not confused about the origin of the software they are using.
2. The Marks
The following are considered the Marks of the project:
 * The name "sans" used in the context of a compiler, data processing tool, or programming language.
 * The project logo (if applicable).
3. Permitted Use
You may use the Marks without prior written permission in the following contexts:
 * Reference: To truthfully refer to this project (e.g., "This script is compiled using sans," or "Compatible with sans").
 * Links: To link to the official GitHub repository (https://github.com/joenorton/sans).
 * Unmodified Distribution: When distributing the software verbatim (unmodified) as strictly allowed by the Apache 2.0 License.
4. Restricted Use
You may not use the Marks in the following ways without explicit written permission:
 * Endorsement: In a way that suggests your project, service, or product is official, endorsed by, or created by the sans maintainers (e.g., calling your consulting firm "sans Solutions").
 * Confusing Similarity: Using a name so similar to "sans" that it causes confusion (e.g., "sans-pro," "sans-plus").
 * Modified Forks: If you fork the repository and make significant changes to the source code (specifically logic that alters the IR, runtime behavior, or determinism guarantees), you should not call the resulting binary "sans." You must choose a new name to avoid confusing users about the strict determinism guarantees of the official project.
5. Naming Your Fork
If you fork this project to add features or change its behavior:
 * Allowed: "Turbo-Compiler (based on sans)" or "MyCompiler (a fork of sans)."
 * Not Allowed: "sans-special-edition" or "The New sans."
